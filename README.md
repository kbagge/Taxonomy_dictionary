# The Taxonomy Dictionary

Version 1.0.4: 30th March 2025

The purpose of this dictionary is to include **all** taxa, so that it can be used from your preferred text editor and correct your spelling mistakes. It should be of good use to anyone working with biology and frequently using taxonomic names in their writing. It will not check if *italics* is used properly, so please be aware of that yourself. It has been built from the following sources:

- [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Backbone Taxonomy](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c) [^1]
- [Catalogue of Life (COL)](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/) [^2] 
- [International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)](https://talk.ictvonline.org/) [^3]
- [List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN)](https://lpsn.dsmz.de/text/introduction) [^4]
- [MycoBank](https://www.mycobank.org/) [^5]
- [Zoobank](https://zoobank.org/) [^6]
- [The World Flora Online](http://www.worldfloraonline.org/) [^7]

All taxonomic entries in the above databases have been **aggregated**, so every single species and subspecies that figure in one of the databases are included. It has been **deduplicated**, so every word appears only once. The result is a dictionary consisting of around **1,4 million taxonomic words**.
It is massive, for a comparison the English dictionary have around 130,000 words. It will mark the words you spell wrong. And you can rely on that the words that are not marked are mostly spelled correct. As a consequence of it's size, the autosuggestions may be subject to error, if there are many similar words. This depends on the spelling engine used and not the dictionary. Many times, it will however suggest a reasonable correction.

The GBIF backbone and COL are already giant sources that should be sufficient for most. My background is in microbiology, so I wanted to make sure that the taxa for bacteria, virus and fungi were up to date, and therefore added LPSN, ICTV and MycoBank. I have also included World Flora Online and Zoobank to give proper coverage of plants and animals. If you find any species lacking or have suggestions for a relevant database to add, please let me know and I will try to incorporate it. 

The repository contains a script (wordlist_script.sh) that was used to generate the dictionary. You can reproduce it yourself on your machine or get inspired and make your own dictionary for another topic. Please be aware that for the LPSN database you need to make a login before you can download the content. Update the lpsnapi.py script with your login credentials before running the wordlist_script.

## Installation
### Mozilla Firefox:
There is an official addon, that can be installed [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/the-taxonomy-dictionary/).
Please see the instructions on the [Github](https://github.com/kbagge/Taxonomy_Dictionary_Firefox) repository for how to enable and use the dictionary after installation.

### LibreOffice:
There is an extension that can be installed for LibreOffice [here](https://extensions.libreoffice.org/en/extensions/show/27369).
Please see the instructions on the [Github](https://github.com/kbagge/Taxonomy_Dictionary_Libreoffice) repository for how to enable and use the dictionary after installation.

### Linux:
The following instructions work if you are using the [hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io/) dictionary.
Download the taxonomy.dic file and place it in `~/Library/Spelling`.
You can now use the dictionary called taxonomy. Hunspell can check a file for multiple languages at the same time. If you would like to use it on a file, and also check for spelling errors for the English language you can use this command:

    $ hunspell -d en_US,taxonomy myFile.txt

### Microsoft Word: (IN PROCESS)
- Download the taxonomy.dic file from this repository.
- Open the taxonomy.dic file in notepad and then press save as and select unicode as format instead of.
- Make a custom dictionary for the user. [Here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-edit-words-in-a-spell-check-dictionary-56e5c373-29f8-4d11-baf6-87151725c0dc) are instructions for how to create a custom dictionary. In short go to File > Options > Proofing  You can call it taxonomy.
- Copy/paste all the content from taxonomy.dic to the newly created custom dictionary. (You can use notepad and CTRL+a, CTRL+c and CTRL+v).
On windows the custom dictionaries are stored at this location: (Be aware that AppData is a hidden directory)

    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\UProof

At last make sure that the new dictionary is enabled in Word, it should be automatically after creation, if not, there is also instructions for that in the link above.
